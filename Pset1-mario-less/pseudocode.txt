1. Prompt user for a number between 1 and 8
If number >1 OR >8 then reprompt user for another input ( do while loop)
if correct print:
     "height":n
     return n*rows and columns

     Rows and columns will be in loop
     print # as long as i smaller than n (loop)
     add in new line so that i prints new lines (also loop inside of i loop)
     move new line outside of loop so it prints n #s and then new line repeat

     Currently returning a square:
        : i goes from 0 to n so long as it is smaller than n
        : j goes from 0 to i so long as it iis smaller than i plus 1 sp will print n #s
        therefor j will print i per line and i counts from 0 up to n



    returns left sided pyramid:
        : another loop to space from right
        :loop must have as many spaces as n-1
        : so k = n-1 and repeats as long as it is greater than i (#)
